# 🏏 T20 Cricket Data Analysis (Python + Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end analysis of T20 cricket data**, built using **Python** for data processing and analysis and **Power BI** for interactive visualizations.

The goal of this project is to analyze **player and team performance**, uncover meaningful insights, and present them through a **clean, interactive dashboard** suitable for decision-making and selection analysis.

### This project demonstrates:
- Real-world data handling
- Analytical thinking
- Strong visualization and storytelling skills

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- GitHub (project versioning & documentation)

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of:
- Match-level data
- Batting performance statistics
- Bowling performance statistics
- Player attributes (team, role, batting/bowling style)

Data is sourced in **CSV and JSON formats** and processed using Python before visualization in Power BI.
